# Pong
Welcome to the Pong game, a classic arcade game where two players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth. This version of Pong is implemented using the Love framework and Lua programming language.

### How to Run the Game

To run the Pong game, follow these steps:

1. **Install Love Framework**:
   
   Download and install the [Love framework](https://love2d.org/) if you haven't already.

2. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karmali-irfan/2D-Games/pong.git

3. **Run the Game**:
   Navigate to the repository's directory and launch the game using the Love framework. **(Only MacOS)**
   ```bash
   cd #make_sure_you_are_in_your_home_directory
   open -a love path/to/pong

## Controls

- Player 1 controls the left paddle using the `W` and `S` keys.
- Player 2 controls the right paddle using the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys.
- The objective is to prevent the ball from hitting your side of the screen while trying to make the ball pass your opponent's paddle.
